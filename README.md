# Ad-Hoc Predictive Modelling Analyses

## Objective
This repository contains ad-hoc analyses on various datasets in the domain of predictive modelling. The goal is to explore and apply predictive modelling techniques to uncover insights.

## Technologies Used
- **cardiovascular-disease-analysis.ipynb**:
   - Python
   - Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings/Results
- Identified significant features for predicting cardiovascular disease, such as cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and activity levels.
- Revealed unexpected findings, including weak associations of smoking and alcohol consumption with cardiovascular disease, suggesting potential data quality issues.
- Improved model accuracy by directly maximizing the likelihood function and addressing data outliers in features like blood pressure.

## How to Replicate
Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdrianKuklaPL/predictive-modelling-analyses.git
